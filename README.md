# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview
 
In this challenge, we were tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. We were provided with a financial dataset, listing months/years and the profits or losses against them.

We were asked to calculate:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * Track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
